# The Magic of Pizza

There are many different ways to enjoy your pizza. Here are four distinct types offering a glimpse into the flavorful and fun world of pizzas.

## Neopolitan Pizza

Originating from Naples, Italy, Neapolitan pizza is often considered the original and most traditional form. It features a thin, soft crust with a delightfully puffy edge, known as the "cornicione." Due to strict guidelines, authentic Neapolitan pizza uses specific ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana. It's typically baked at very high temperatures in a wood-fired oven for a short period, resulting in a slightly charred, bubbly crust and a fresh, simple flavor. Common varieties include the Margherita, with tomato, mozzarella, fresh basil, and olive oil, and the Marinara, with tomato, garlic, oregano, and olive oil.

## New York-Style Pizza

A giant of the American pizza scene, New York-style pizza is characterized by its large, thin, and foldable slices. This style evolved from Neapolitan pizza, adapted by Italian immigrants in New York City. The crust is typically hand-tossed, resulting in a crispy edge and a chewy interior that's sturdy enough to be eaten on the go. Often sold in wide slices, it's traditionally topped with a layer of tomato sauce and a generous amount of shredded, low-moisture mozzarella cheese. Pepperoni is a classic topping, but New York-style pizzas can accommodate a wide variety of additional ingredients.

## Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza

As its name suggests, Chicago deep-dish pizza is known for its incredibly thick crust, which is baked in a round, high-sided pan similar to a cake pan. This creates a deep basin that allows for a large volume of toppings. Unlike other pizzas, the ingredients are layered in reverse order: the crust is lined with mozzarella cheese, followed by toppings like Italian sausage, pepperoni, and vegetables, and then finished with a chunky tomato sauce on top. The baking time is significantly longer than for thin-crust pizzas, resulting in a rich, hearty, and almost casserole-like meal.

## Sicilian Pizza

Hailing from Sicily, Italy, this style typically features a thick, airy, and rectangular crust that is often baked in a well-oiled pan, giving the bottom a distinctively crisp and slightly fried texture. Sicilian pizza is known for its spongy dough and is traditionally topped with a robust tomato sauce, onions, anchovies, and herbs, often with less cheese than other styles, or sometimes no cheese at all. In America, Sicilian-style pizza often has a thicker layer of mozzarella cheese and a variety of other toppings, but it retains its characteristic rectangular shape and thick, focaccia-like crust.
